                <a href="https://remodel-anesthesiology.osu.edu/">REMODEL (REsident MilestOne-baseD Educational Learning)</a>
                is a system designed by David Stahl, MD (Associate Residency Program Director) in collaboration with the
                CAPSTONE Teams from The Ohio State University
                <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,
                and in conjunction with leadership from OSU Department Anesthesiology for the
                benefit of our anesthesiology residents.
            </p>
            <p>REMODEL would simply not exist without the hard work of the following students who contributed to the project
                as part of their

                (part of their undergraduate degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering).
                Special thanks to Professor Al Cline and

                Permissions for University colors and imaging were obtained from the Director of Digital Services at Wexner
                Medical Center Marketing & Strategic Communications. The initial concept of residents selecting their
